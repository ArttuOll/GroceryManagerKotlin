# GroceryManager

Android app for managing and scheduling your groceries!



## The problem

I am way too lazy to write grocery lists, which is unfortunate, since I know precisely how long each item in my fridge lasts. 

Some last for a week, some for two, but what many times happens is that I end up buying the same item way too often or way 

too frequently, just because I haven't written a grocery list that would reflect the correct consumption frequencies of the items. 

If only someone could write a grocery list like this for me!
